> 又于西园弄狗，著进贤冠，带绶。又驾四驴，帝躬自操辔，驱驰周旋

> 冀聞而密遣掩捕，著乃變易姓名，托病偽死，結蒲為人，市棺殯送。冀知其詐，求得，笞殺之。 太原郝絜、胡武，好危言高論，與著友善，絜、武嘗連名奏記三府，薦海內高士，而不詣冀。冀追怒之，敕中都官稱檄禽捕，遂誅下家，死者六十餘人。絜初逃亡，知不得免，因輿梓奏書冀門，書入，仰藥而死，家乃得全。
> Liang Ji heard about this, and he sent men in secret to arrest Yuan Zhu. Yuan Zhu changed his name, and pretended that he had taken ill and died. He made the figure of a man out of rushes, bought a coffin, and had a public funeral performed. Liang Ji, however, found out about the deception, he hunted for Yuan Zhu and caught him, and then he had him flogged to death. 
> Hao Jie and Hu Wu, both men from Taiyuan, enjoyed high principles and forthright argument, and they had been very good friends with Yuan Zhu. On a later occasion they sent in to the offices of the Three Excellencies a list which they had prepared jointly, with the names of good scholars from all over the empire whom they recommended for office. They never paid a courtesy call on Liang Ji.  Liang Ji heard about this, and he was furious. He had the office of the capital put out a summons for the arrest of the two men. Hu Wu's whole household was punished, and more than sixty people died. Hao Jie had already fled, but he realised that he was not going to get away. So he took a carriage with a coffin to Liang Ji's gateway, and there he handed in a letter. When the letter was taken inside, Hao Jie took poison and died. By this means, his family was saved.

> “少年 was a general term in Qin and Han times for a subclass of youth who usually lived in an urban setting, were at odds with the government, and were often involved in disturbances ... their  loyality to each other and rowdy behavior, makes these young men not totally unlike the youth gangs of modern America”
